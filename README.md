DarkDays 🌑

DarkDays is a 2D side-scrolling psychological horror roguelike developed for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). Built on the Lutro engine, it delivers a claustrophobic, pixel-art experience centered on resource management and high-stakes survival.
🕹️ Features

    2D Horror Atmosphere: Immersive, hand-crafted pixel art inspired by the "Lone Survivor" aesthetic, optimized for the PSP's screen.

    The Loop: Procedural loot and enemy spawns ensure no two runs are identical.

    Hardcore Save System: Progress is only recorded upon clearing specific sectors. Dying sends you back to your last successful sector clear.

    Lutro Powered: Built using the LÖVE-inspired Lua framework for smooth 2D performance on retro handheld hardware.

    More information to come, but you get the gist.
